1 hour video by Bro Code it's called "Learn Python in 1 hour!"

I already new the beginner stuff about coding and just needed to
learn the syntax tho I don't think I'm even close enough to type
my first proper program in python it's a good video to get the flow of it

he has a 12 hour python video but I don't realy like learning by watching 
videos I would rather just read a book or something like learncpp.com

good video would recommend for someone who already knows how to code and
is looking to try a different coding language
